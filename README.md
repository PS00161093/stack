# stacks & queues
Create your own Stack & Queue using Java

1. Both are linear data structure - which means it allows us to transverse i.e go through data elements sewuentially.
2. No random access.
3. Operations can be done with elements only at the beginning & the end of the data structure.
4. Can be implemented using Arrays or LinkedList.

5. Function calls are stored in Stack.
6. Browser history also uses Stack.

7. Queue Uses: Any waiting list app, any lifting app or a printer.
8. enqueue - add or push.
9. dequeue - delete or remove.
10. Implementing a Queue from Arrays is not good as adding or removing items is expensive.
11. Stack may be implemented using Arrays.
