Create your own Stack & Queue using Java

1. Both are linear data structure - which means it allows us to transverse i.e go through data elements sewuentially.
2. No random access.
3. Operations can be done with elements only at the beginning & the end of the data structure.
4. Can be implemented using Arrays or LinkedList.
